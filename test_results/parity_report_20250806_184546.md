# DiskANN Rust vs C++ Parity Test Report

**Generated**: Wed Aug  6 18:45:55 UTC 2025
**Test Suite**: Comprehensive Parity Testing
**Configuration**: 
- Tier 1 Only: true
- Performance Tests: disabled
- Stress Tests: disabled
- C++ Reference: not configured

## Test Results

### Test Output Summary
```
error: no test target named `comprehensive_parity_tests::test_tier1_foundational` in default-run packages
help: available test targets:
    comprehensive_parity_tests
    correctness_validation
    integration_tests
```

## Summary

This report shows the results of comprehensive parity testing between the Rust DiskANN implementation and the Microsoft C++ reference implementation.

### Test Tiers

1. **Tier 1: Foundational Parity** - Critical correctness tests that must pass
2. **Tier 2: Robustness Testing** - Edge cases and advanced features  
3. **Tier 3: Performance Benchmarking** - Performance comparison and optimization

### Next Steps

Based on the test results above:
- Address any Tier 1 failures immediately (blocking issues)
- Review Tier 2 failures for robustness improvements
- Use Tier 3 results to guide performance optimization
